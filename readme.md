#  100 Days of Python Bootcamp Projects

This repository contains several **Python projects** I have created while doing the **100 Days of Python Bootcamp**.  
The projects demonstrate a mix of **basic Python concepts, logic building, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

##  Overview

During the bootcamp, I have worked on a variety of small projects to practice Python programming, problem solving, and OOP.  
These projects range from console games to utility programs, each highlighting different Python concepts.

##  Features Across Projects
- Strong emphasis on **Python fundamentals** (loops, conditionals, functions)  
- Practice with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- Hands-on use of Python modules (`random`, `time`, `turtle`, etc.)  
- User input handling and basic error checking  
- Modular and clean coding structure for larger projects  

---

##  Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries needed (all projects run in console)

## ▶ How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or IDE.  
3. Run the Python file of the project you want to try:
   ```bash
   python3 project_file.py
Follow on-screen instructions for each project.
