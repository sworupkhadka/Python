##  Projects Included

### 1. Random Walk
- Turtle moves in **random directions**.
- Each step is drawn in a **random color**.
- Demonstrates **loops, randomization, and RGB colors**.

### 2. Shapes and Polygons
- Draws **polygons from triangle to decagon**.
- Each polygon has a **random color**.
- Introduces **functions, loops, and lists**.

### 3. Multi-Shape Dashed Lines
- Draws **multiple shapes** with **dashed lines**.
- Useful for learning **pen control, loops, and spacing**.
- Creates a **geometric pattern effect**.

### 4. Spirograph
- Turtle draws a **spirograph pattern**.
- Uses **random RGB colors** for each circle.
- Teaches **angles, loops, and functions**.
- Smooth, colorful, and visually appealing.

##  Key Concepts Learned
- **Turtle Graphics**: Using the `turtle` module for creative drawing.
- **Loops & Iterations**: Repeating patterns with `for` loops.
- **Functions**: Modular and reusable code.
- **Randomization**: Random colors and directions.
- **RGB Colors**: Using `colormode(255)` for colorful graphics.
- **Dashed Lines**: Pen control using `penup()` and `pendown()`.
- **Object-Oriented Basics**: Creating and controlling `Turtle` objects.
