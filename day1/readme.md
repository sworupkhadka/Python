-- Python Basics

This README explains some basic concepts in Python including printing, comments, string concatenation, and multi-line output.

-- Printing in Python

The simplest method to print output is using the `print()` function:
python
print('Hello World')


-- comment   
x = 5  # This is an inline comment
uses # for comments

we ans also use triple quotations ti=o comment multiple lines like """ '""" or ''' ''' 
or also use 
command + / in mac 


-- String Concatenation
The + operator is used to concatenate strings:
print('Hello ' + 'Angela')           
Hello Angela         
 #there is a space after hello i.e. 'hello__' +     

-- Printing in Multiple Lines

To print text on different lines, use the newline character \n

print('Hello \n Hello')
Output:
Hello
Hello


-- use use input command to ask for inputs
eg. input("what is your name?")

-- variables in python 
eg 
name=input ("what is your name ")
print(name)
