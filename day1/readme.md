<h3>Printing in Python </h3>
The simplest method to print output is using the `print()` function:  
print('Hello World')<br>


<h3>Comments </h3>
Python uses # for single-line comments:
x = 5  # This is an inline comment
Tip:
You can also use triple quotes for multi-line comments.
"""
This is a multi-line comment
You can use triple quotes for it
"""
On Mac, you can also use Command + / to toggle comments in many editors.<br>


<h3> String Concatenation </h3>
The + operator is used to concatenate (join) strings:
print('Hello ' + 'Angela')
Output:
Hello Angela
(Notice there‚Äôs a space after Hello so the output is properly spaced.)<br>


<h3>Printing on Multiple Lines </h3>
To print text on different lines, use the newline character \n:
print('Hello \nHello')
Output:
Hello
Hello<br>


<h3>Taking Input </h3>
You can ask the user for input using the input() function:
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(name) <br>


<h3>Variables in Python</h3>
Variables store data. Example:
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello " + name)
Output Example:
What is your name? John
Hello John
