Modulo Operator (%)

Odd & Even Number Check

Pizza Order Calculator

Treasure Island Mini Game

<h3>BMI Check with Conditions</h3>
weight = 85
height = 1.85

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

if bmi < 18.5:
    print("underweight")
elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:
    print("normal weight")
elif 25 <= bmi < 29.9:
    print("overweight")

<h3>Rollercoaster Height Check</h3>
print("welcome to the roller coaster ")
height = int(input("please enter your height in cm: \n"))

if height >= 120:
    print("you can ride the rollercoaster")
else:
    print("you cant ride the rollercoaster")

<h3>Logical Operators</h3>

>= greater than or equal to

<= less than or equal to

== equals to

!= not equal to

<h3>Nested If-Else (Rollercoaster with Age Pricing)</h3>
print("Welcome to the roller coaster ")
height = int(input("Please enter your height in cm: \n"))

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster")
    
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    if age > 18:
        print("You have to pay $12")
    elif age > 12 and age <= 18:  # python uses elif instead of elseif
        print("You have to pay $7")
    else:
        print("You have to pay $5")

else:
    print("You can't ride the rollercoaster")

<h3>Rollercoaster with Photos & Special Age Pricing</h3>
print("Welcome to the roller coaster ")
height = int(input("Please enter your height in cm: \n"))

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster")
    
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    if 18 <= age < 45:
        bill = 12
        print("your tickets are $12")
    elif age > 12 and age <= 18:
        bill = 7
        print("your tickets are $7")
    elif age < 12:
        bill = 5
        print("your tickets are $5")
    elif 45 <= age <= 55:
        bill = 0
        print("your entry is free")

    want_photo = input("do you want a photo taken? type y for yes n for no:\n")
    if want_photo == "y":
        bill += 3       # add $3 to bill
    print(f"your final bill is ${bill}")       # fstring
    
else:
    print("You can't ride the rollercoaster")

<h3>Modulo Operator</h3>

Gives the remainder of division.

Examples:

print(10 % 2)  # 0
print(10 % 3)  # 1

<h3>Odd or Even Number Check</h3>
n = int(input("enter a number:\n"))
if n % 2 == 0:
    print("the number is even")
else:
    print("the number is odd")

<h3>üí∞ Pizza Order Calculator</h3>
print("Welcome to Domino's")

size = input("What size of pizza do you want? S, M or L:\n")
pepperoni = input("Do you want pepperoni on your pizza? Y or N:\n")
extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra cheese on your pizza? Y or N:\n")

bill = 0  # initialize bill

# price as per size
if size == "S":
    bill += 15
elif size == "M":
    bill += 20
elif size == "L":
    bill += 25
else:
    print("Please type S, M or L")

# adding pepperoni
if pepperoni == "Y":
    if size == "S":
        bill += 2   
    else:
        bill += 3   

# adding extra cheese
if extra_cheese == "Y":  
    bill += 1

print(f"Your final bill amount is ${bill}")

<h3>üèù Treasure Island Mini Game</h3>
print("Welcome to Treasure Island. Your mission is to find the treasure.")

choice1 = input("Choose whether you want to go left or right: L or R \n")

if choice1 == "L":
    choice2 = input("You have come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. "
                    "Do you want to swim or wait for a boat? S or W \n")

    if choice2 == "W":
        choice3 = input("You arrived at the island unharmed. "
                        "There is a house with 3 doors: Yellow, Red, and Blue. "
                        "Choose one: Y, B, or R \n")

        if choice3 == "R":
            print("You entered the room full of fire. Game Over.")
        elif choice3 == "Y":
            print("You found the treasure! You win!")
        elif choice3 == "B":
            print("You chose the room full of water. You lose.")
        else:
            print("Choose either B, Y, or R.")
    else:
        print("You got attacked by a trout. Game Over.")

elif choice1 == "R":
    print("You fell into a hole. Game Over.")
else:
    print("Please choose L or R.")
