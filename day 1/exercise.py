# # Variables
# # We have 2 variables glass1 and glass2.
# # glass1 contains milk and glass2 contains juice.
# # Write 3 lines of code to switch the contents of the variables.
# # You are not allowed to type the words "milk" or "juice".
# # You are only allowed to use variables to solve this exercise


# # input Code 
# # glass1 = "milk"
# # glass2 = "juice"



# #output code
# use of temporary variable say x


glass1 = "milk"
glass2 = "juice"


#method
x=glass1
glass1=glass2
glass2=x
